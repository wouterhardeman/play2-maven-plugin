Release notes:

**1.0.0-beta3 (2015.06.27)**

Better Play! 2.4.x support. One backward incompatible change, 'enhance' mojo is not bound to 'play2' lifecycle anymore. It must be added explicitely in the project. This change follows SBT change (read about bytecode enhancement in [Play! 2.4 Migration Guide](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Migration24)). In consequence, enhancement (if needed) must be configured in projects using previous Play! versions too.

**1.0.0-alpha5 (2013.10.28)**

Many small changes, refactoring and polishing the code

Many new test projects added, most important:

- [Activator projects](https://play2-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test-projects/activator) - copied from [Typesafe Activator templates](http://www.typesafe.com/activator/templates) and mavenized

- [WebJars test projects for Play! 2.1.x](https://play2-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test-projects/play21/external-modules/webjars) - copied from [WebJars project](https://github.com/webjars/sample-play2/tree/play-2.1) and mavenized

- [WebJars test projects for Play! 2.2.x](https://play2-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test-projects/play22/external-modules/webjars) - copied from [webJars project](https://github.com/webjars/sample-play2/tree/play-2.2.x) and mavenized

**1.0.0-alpha4 (2013.10.24)**

New features:

For the first time plugin was tested with independent Play! modules: Deadbolt and SecureSocial. It works!

Changes:

- [Issue 11](http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=11) remove tricky "mainLang" autodetection mechanism. "scala" is not default "mainLang" value. If you need "java", you have to add it to plugin's configuration section. See [example projects for Java](http://play2-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test-projects/play22/java/)

**1.0.0-alpha3 (2013.10.21)**

New features:

- [Issue 7](http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=7) Play! 2.1.x and 2.2.x support.

Fixed:

- [Issue 8](http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=8) - fix bug in "start" script generated by "dist" mojo

- [Issue 9](http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=9) - add "mainLang" configuration parameter to avoid autodetection

- [Issue 10](http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=10) - add "scalacOptions" and "javacOptions" configuration parameters

**1.0.0-alpha2 (2013.09.20)**

Fixed:

- [Issue 2](http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=2) - configurable source encoding ("-encoding" option added to javac and scalac compilers) and full debug information in compiled classes ("-g" option added to javac compiler)

**1.0.0-alpha1 (2013.04.23)**

This is the first, experimental version.

It supports:

- **Java** and **Scala** sources compilation,

- **Coffee**, **JS** and **Less** assets compilation,

- **runnig tests** with Maven Surefire Plugin,

- **packaging** using Maven Jar Plugin,

- "**dist**" and "**dist-exploded**" packaging (a'la Play2 "dist" task),

- "**run**", "**start**" and "**stop**" commands for running Play! server, but without hot reloading yet

- multimodule builds (with modularized routes for example),

It does not support:

- hot reloading when running server,

- war packaging ([Play2 War plugin](https://github.com/dlecan/play2-war-plugin) integration?)
