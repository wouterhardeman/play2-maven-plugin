<font color='red'><strong>2015.06.27 - 1.0.0-beta3 version released</strong></font>

- <font color='red'><strong>IMPORTANT - 'enhance' mojo removed from 'play2' packaging lifecycle</strong></font>, it must be added explicitely in the project, if needed. Play! Framework authors don't write, when it's needed in [Play! 2.4 Migration Guide](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Migration24). From my experience - only in Java projects using Spring Framework (form binding), Hibernate or Ebean.

- Play! Framework version used upgraded to 2.4.1
