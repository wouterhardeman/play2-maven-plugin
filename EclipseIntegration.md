# Eclipse IDE integration #

To import Maven project with **play2** packaging into Eclipse IDE **1.0.0-alpha6** or later version of the plugin is required.

Use Scala IDE bundle (http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html) or install Scala IDE plugin from it's update site.

**Don't use Eclipse 4.5** (Mars), Scala IDE is not compatible with this Eclipse version yet.

There is one problem with importing Play! project to Eclipse (as Maven project).
M2Eclipse does not treat such project as Java project, because **maven-compiler-plugin**'s **compile** and **testCompile**
mojos are not part of **play2** packaging lifecycle (**sbt-compiler-maven-plugin**'s **compile** and **testCompile** mojos are used instead).

A workaround is required (or a proper Eclipse plugin, which will be implemented later).

## Import steps: ##

### 1. A workaround ###

Add this code snipped to project's **pom.xml** file:

```
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>eclipse</id>

            <build>
                <plugins>
                    <plugin>
                        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                        <configuration>
                            <skipMain>true</skipMain>
                            <skip>true</skip>
                        </configuration>
                        <executions>
                            <execution>
                                <id>default-compile</id>
                                <goals><goal>compile</goal></goals>
                            </execution>
                            <execution>
                                <id>default-testCompile</id>
                                <goals><goal>testCompile</goal></goals>
                            </execution>
                        </executions>
                    </plugin>
                </plugins>
            </build>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
```

This adds **eclipse** profile with **maven-compiler-plugin**'s **compile** and **testCompile** mojos.

This profile is intended to be used exclusively by Eclipse. Don't use it when building with Maven from command line (it would unnecessarily slow down the build).
Inside Eclipse it will do nothing during compilation, but this is enough to properly recognize imported project as Java project.

### 2. Import the project as Maven project. ###

Click **Next**

Click **Finish**

When import process finishes, the project looks like on the image below.

As you can see, there are many compilation errors. The project is treated as any other Java project. Eclipse Java compiler (JDT) cannot compile Scala code and fails with huge amount of compilation errors.

### 3. Add Scala nature ###

Now Java project has to be converted into a Scala project. This is accomplished by adding **Scala Nature** to it.

After adding Scala Nature Eclipse recompiles the project.

There are no errors in the project anymore.

On above picture you can see routes and templates files generated by the plugin in **target/src\_managed/main** directory.


Have a nice day :)
